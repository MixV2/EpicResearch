# Authenticating by Token to Token
This grant type, `token_to_token`, can be used to generate an access token from an already existing access token.    

### ⚠️ However, this grant type has been deprecated on all public clients.

For example, if you had an access token (e.g. `abc123`), you could generate more access tokens (e.g. `def456` and `ghi789`) without invalidating the first token.
